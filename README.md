A Python3 / PyQt5 based application.

This is definately a work in progress (solely for a learning experience).

I'm using it as a way to work my way through learning some PyQt5 with a little personal project of my own.

This is based on the EFF_long_wordlist referenced at https://www.eff.org/dice .  

p.s.  Progress, should you check in now and then, will be very slow as this is only a side-hobby/brain stimulating experience.
