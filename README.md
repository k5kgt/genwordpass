A Python3 / PyQt5 based application.

This is definately a work in progress (solely for a learning experience).

I'm using it as a way to work my way through learning some PyQt5 with a little personal project of my own.

This is originally based on the EFF_long_wordlist referenced at https://www.eff.org/dice .  

However, in order to avoid having to rely on EFF's list, I have generated a fresh list and massaged it down to a lenght of 7776 words. This is the length needed by the potential rolls of a 6 sided die five times.

p.s.  Progress, should you check in now and then, will be very slow as this is only a side-hobby/brain stimulating experience.
